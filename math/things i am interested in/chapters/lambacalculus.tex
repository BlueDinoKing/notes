\section{Introduction}
Lambda calculus was introduced by Alonza Church in the 1930s. It is a rigorous formal system for notationing functions in computer science, providing a framework for the study of functional programming languages.
\section{Core Concepts}
The formal system of lambda calculus has three principal elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Variables: Denoted by indentifiers, such as $x, y, z$.
    \item Abstraction: Defining anonymous functions. Represented by $\lambda x.E$ where $x$ is the parameter and $E$ is the expression.
    \item Application: The operation of applying a function to an argument, expressed as $(\lambda x.E)\, A$ where $A$ is the argument.
\end{itemize}
