\chapter{Functions of Several Variables}
Functions of several variables extend the concept of functions to higher dimensions, allowing for more complex mappings and dependencies.

\section{Continuity}

4 conditions for continuity of $f(x, y)$ at a point $(x_0, y_0)$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $(x_0, y_0)$ is in the domain of $f(x, y)$
    \item $(x_0, y_0)$ is not an isolated point
    \item $\lim_{\substack{x \to x_0\\y \to y_0}} f(x, y)$ exists
    \item $\lim_{\substack{x \to x_0\\y \to y_0}} f(x, y) = f(x_0, y_0)$
\end{itemize}
